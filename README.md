# EasyDelivery

Problem Statement :
Current problem is that the shipping of specimens from current location of a delivery person on the map to different addresses is done by searching individual address one at a time.
Manually enter each and every location is hard and time consuming process.


Unique aspects
Before start of delivering the products we can pin all the locations on the map. 
Pinning locations is as simple as scanning a QR-Code. 
Shows the shortest path from current location to any pin selected.
Worked with Maps using framework CoreLocation,AVFoundation,CoreFoundation
Worked with QR Scanner using AVFoundation. 

Issues Faced
Finding roots to set path.
To specify which annotation is tapped. 
To know whether the QR code is scanned or not.
Accessing back facing camera for capturing QR-Code for different iOS devices.
